Write a Python script to transform a dataset that solves the TASK outlined below, 
using the approach outlined in the plan below.

# TASK:
{{ problem_statement }}

# PLAN:
{{ plan }}

# PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS, IF ANY:
{{history}}

# INSTRUCTIONS
Only return the code of the transformation script, no explanations outside the code. Any explanation should
be in the comments in the code itself, but your overall answer must only consist of the code script.

The script MUST be wrapped in a function called `transformation` and follow this format:

USE ONLY input dataset path, type and schema below to read the input datasets:
{{input_datasets}}

USE ONLY output dataset path schema and type below to write the dataset:
{{output_dataset}}

If the file dont exist, be sure use the right path based on the execution script location.

Always check if the output file is created. If not created raise an exception

```python

def transformation():
    # The transformation code should be here 

if __name__ == "__main__":
    transformation()

``` 

- The code validation will be like this: 
```bash
python transformation.py
```

- Use only {{ allowed_packages }}. Do NOT use any packages that are not part of this list of the Python standard library.
